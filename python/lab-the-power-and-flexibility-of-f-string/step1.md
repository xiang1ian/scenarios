# Basic F-String Usage

To create an f-string, simply prefix a string literal with the letter 'f' or 'F':

Open the Python shell by typing the following command in the terminal.

```bash
python3
```

Then, enter the following code.

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30
print(f"{name} is {age} years old.")
```

Output:

```
Alice is 30 years old.
```
