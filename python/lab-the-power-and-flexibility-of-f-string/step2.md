# F-String Expressions

You can include any Python expressions inside the curly braces `{}` of an f-string. The expressions are evaluated and the result is converted to a string and inserted into the f-string.

Here's an example:

```python
x = 10
y = 20
print(f"The sum of {x} and {y} is {x+y}.")
```

Output:

```
The sum of 10 and 20 is 30.
```
