# Nested F-Strings

F-strings can be nested, allowing you to format an expression inside another f-string:

```python
age = 10
name = "Alice"
formatted_name = f"{name},{age}"
print(f"Name: {formatted_name}")
```

Output:

```
Name: Alice,10
```

That's it! Now you have a solid understanding of Python f-strings and can use them to make your code more readable and concise. Happy coding!
