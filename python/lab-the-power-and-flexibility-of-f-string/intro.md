# Python F-String Tutorial

In this tutorial, you will learn about Python F-strings, a modern and concise way to format strings in Python. F-strings were introduced in Python 3.6 and have quickly become popular among Python developers for their readability and ease of use.

F-strings, also known as "formatted string literals", are a convenient way to embed expressions inside string literals. The expressions are enclosed in curly braces `{}` and are evaluated at runtime, then formatted and substituted into the resulting string.
